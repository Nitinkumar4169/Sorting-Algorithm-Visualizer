# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application that helps you visualize and understand how different sorting algorithms work. Watch as arrays are sorted in real time, compare the performance of algorithms, and gain an intuitive understanding of sorting mechanisms commonly used in computer science.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:**  
  Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

- **Interactive Visualization:**  
  Step through the sorting process, watch as elements move and swap, and see the algorithm in action.

- **Adjustable Array Size & Speed:**  
  Change the size of the array and the speed of the visualization to suit your preferences.

- **Color-Coded Bars:**  
  Elements are represented as bars whose colors change to indicate comparisons, swaps, and sorted sections.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nitinkumar4169/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will usually run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- Select a sorting algorithm from the menu.
- Adjust the array size and visualization speed using the provided sliders.
- Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array.
- Click "Start" to begin the visualization.

## Supported Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- (Add more as you implement!)
